# Battleship game

A Battleship game programmed during the Route to Code course in February 2023.
It uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
To play this game, you can either go to[nataliehodson.github.io/battleship](https://nataliehodson.github.io/battleship/) to access the website, or you can download the JS, HTML, and CSS files from this depository and open up index.html to play it on your own computer. 

The game has two options, single player and two player.

## Single player

Play against your computer.

Place your ships and the computer places its ships randomly.
Then, shoot the computer's ships while it fires randomly at yours.

## Two player

Each player enters their name and then places their ships.
Then, players each get a turn to fire at the other's ships.


## Improvements

- Computer could shoot more intelligently, shooting close to where it last hit.
- Add a restart button which clears everything and sends user back to the first screen where they select how many people are playing.
- Might be better suited to a React app, instead of hiding/showing divs, I could use React components.
