# Battleship game

A Battleship game programmed during the Route to Code course in February 2023.

Go to [nataliehodson.github.io/battleship](https://nataliehodson.github.io/battleship/) to access the website and play Battleship.

The game has two options, single player and two player.

## Single player

Play against your computer.

Place your ships and the computer places its ships randomly.
Then, shoot the computer's ships while it fires randomly at yours.

## Two player

Each player enters their name and then places their ships.
Then, players each get a turn to fire at the other's ships.


## Improvements

- Computer could shoot more intelligently, shooting close to where it last hit.
- Add a restart button which clears everything and sends user back to the first screen where they select how many people are playing.
